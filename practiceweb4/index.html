                        <p class="card-text">PUBG: Battlegrounds (formerly known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of Korean publisher Krafton, formerly known as Bluehole. The game is based on previous modifications for other games created by Brendan Greene under the pseudonym "PlayerUnknown", the concept of which was inspired by the Japanese film "Battle Royale" (2000). As a result, this led to the creation of an independent game, where Green acted as the lead game designer. There are up to 100 players in the game who land on the island, after which they search for equipment and weapons to kill other participants and at the same time stay alive themselves. The available safe zone on the in-game map begins to decrease over time, making the available space more cramped and the probability of a collision between players higher. The last surviving player or team wins the round.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The player's goal is to advance along the game's trophy road, participate in battles with other players, as well as discover and improve new game characters with unique abilities and characteristics.

The gameplay of the game focuses on defeating a team of other players, or an AI-led opponent, alone, as a team of two people, or in a cooperative of three or five people, in a variety of game modes. Players can choose characters, each with their own skills and superpowers. Characters can be obtained in the in—game store for credits, and gadgets, star powers and equipment can be purchased with coins.</p>
